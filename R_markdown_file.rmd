# 10.3.3 Exercises:

**1.) Explore the distribution of each of the x, y, and z variables in diamonds. What do you learn? Think about a diamond and how you might decide which dimension is the length, width, and depth.**

[Graphs of Distributions of X, Y, and Z variables:]{.underline}

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Distribution of x variable

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = x)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, fill = "skyblue", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of x")
```

```{r echo=TRUE}

# Distribution of y
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = y)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, fill = "lightgreen", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of y") +
  xlab("y (mm)") + ylab("Count") +
  xlim(0, 10)  # Limit the x-axis to range from 0 to 10

```

```{r echo=TRUE}

ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = z)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1, fill = "salmon", color = "black") +  # Create histogram with specified binwidth and colors
  ggtitle("Distribution of z") +  # Add title to the plot
  xlab("z (mm)") + ylab("Count") +  # Label the x and y axes
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 10))
```

[What do I learn:]{.underline}

All three distributions are right skew, with a concentration around the smaller dimensions. The distributions of X and Y are similar (\~4.25,\~9.0) while Z has a smaller average dimension and a slightly tighter spread with a range around (\~2.3,\~5.4).

[Deciding Dimensions:]{.underline}

The two longer and nearly identically distributed dimensions (x and y) are likely width and length while the shorter and tighter distributed dimension is likely and intuitively depth.

**2.) Explore the distribution of price. Do you discover anything unusual or surprising? (Hint: Carefully think about the binwidth and make sure you try a wide range of values.)**

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Create a histogram of the 'price' variable
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 25, fill = "salmon", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Diamond Price") +
  xlab("Price (USD)") + ylab("Count")

```

[Discoveries:]{.underline}

There seems to be a weird and significant gap in distribution of prices around \~1800 USD, as well as a small spike around \~4000 USD. The distribution is also extremely right skewed with a concentration around \~1000 USD.

**3.) How many diamonds are 0.99 carat? How many are 1 carat? What do you think is the cause of the difference?**

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Count diamonds with 0.99 carat
count_0.99 <- sum(diamonds$carat == 0.99)

# Count diamonds with 1 carat
count_1 <- sum(diamonds$carat == 1)

# Output the results
count_0.99
count_1

```

[Analysis of Carat counts:]{.underline}

There are 23 diamonds that are 0.99 carat, and 1558 diamonds that are one 1.0 carat. This significant difference is likely due to rounding conventions and psychological marketing tactics. 1 carat may be seen as a milestone size, so people may consider the difference in value of 1 carat and 0.99 carats as more significant than it really is, and thus unwilling to pay fair value for a 0.99 carat diamond.

**4.) Compare and contrast coord_cartesian() vs. xlim() or ylim() when zooming in on a histogram. What happens if you leave binwidth unset? What happens if you try and zoom so only half a bar shows?**

#### 

[*Plots with zooms of Price Distribution from (1700, 2100):*]{.underline}

```{r echo=TRUE}
#Coord_Cartesian() zoom
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "salmon", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Coord_Cartesian Zoom: Price (1700, 2100)") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1700, 2100))  # Zoom into the price range 1700 to 2100
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10, fill = "salmon", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Xlim() Zoomed-in Price, bin width left unset") +
  xlim(1700, 2100)  # Remove data outside the price range 1700 to 2100
```

#### 

[*Plots with zooms of Price Distribution from (1700, 2100) with bin-width left unset:*]{.underline}

```{r echo=TRUE}
#Coord_Cartesian() zoom w/o binwidth
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = , fill = "salmon", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Coord_Cartesian Zoom, bin-width left unset:") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1700, 2100))  # Zoom into the price range 1700 to 2100
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = , fill = "salmon", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Xlim() Zoomed-in Price, bin width left unset") +
  xlim(1700, 2100)  # Remove data outside the price range 1700 to 2100
```

[Plots with Zooms of Price Distribution to a Partial Bar:]{.underline}

```{r echo=TRUE}
#Coord_Cartesian() zoom to half bar
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20, fill = "salmon", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Coord_Cartesian Zoom, partial bar:") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(1700, 1705))  # Zoom into the price range 1700 to 2100
```

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20, fill = "salmon", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Xlim() Zoomed-in Price, partial bar?") +
  xlim(1700, 1705) 
```

[Analysis:]{.underline}

Coord_Cartesian() allows you to zoom in without modfying or removing any data points, while xlim() or ylim() restrict and filter the data that is plotted to only the section specified. This means the scale of the plot is changed to fit the smaller "zoomed" section.

[Bin-width Unset:]{.underline}

If you leave binwidth unset ggplot2 automatically selects an "appropriate" bin size. However, this means with Coord_Cartesian the bin size will likely be too large for the plot [not an issue with xlim() or ylim()...].

[Zooming to half a bar:]{.underline}

If you try and zoom so only half a bar shows, Coord_Cartesian will show the truncated or partial bar (within the zoom of the larger plot) while xlim() or ylim() will show a blank chart in the specified range.

# 10.4.1 Exercises:

**1.) What happens to missing values in a histogram? What happens to missing values in a bar chart? Why is there a difference in how missing values are handled in histograms and bar charts?**

[Change 10% of Price Values to Missing:]{.underline}

```{r echo=TRUE}

set.seed(123)

# Introduce missing values in the 'clarity' column by randomly setting 10% of the values to NA
missing_indices <- sample(1:nrow(diamonds), size = 0.1 * nrow(diamonds))  # Randomly choose 10% of rows
diamonds$price[missing_indices] <- NA  # Assign NA to these selected rows
sum(is.na(diamonds$price)) 

```

[Histogram of Prices w/ Missing Values:]{.underline}

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Load required libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Create a histogram for the 'price' variable in diamonds dataset
# This will automatically exclude any missing values (NA) from the plot
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 250, fill = "salmon", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Diamond Price") +
  xlab("Price (USD)") + ylab("Count")

```

[Change 10% of Clarity Values to Missing:]{.underline}

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Set a seed for reproducibility
set.seed(123)

# Introduce missing values in the 'clarity' column by randomly setting 10% of the values to NA
missing_indices <- sample(1:nrow(diamonds), size = 0.1 * nrow(diamonds))  # Randomly choose 10% of rows
diamonds$clarity[missing_indices] <- NA  # Assign NA to these selected rows

# Check how many missing values were introduced
sum(is.na(diamonds$clarity))  # Count the number of NA values in 'clarity'


```

Bar Chart of Diamon Clarities w/ Missing Values\*

```{r echo=TRUE}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = clarity)) +
  geom_bar(fill = "salmon", color = "black") +
  ggtitle("Bar Chart of Diamond Clarity") +
  xlab("Clarity") + ylab("Count")
```

[Missing Values in a Histogram:]{.underline}

Missing Values in a Histogram are ignored by default as a histogram is intended to show distribution of continuous variables (and the missing values will not fit in a bin).

[Missing Values in a Bar Chart:]{.underline}

Missing Values in a Bar Chart are included under an seperate category (ex. N/A) as seen above. Bar charts are intended to show distribution of categorical values, and the missing values are considered an additional category.

**2.) What does `na.rm = TRUE` do in [`mean()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/mean.html) and [`sum()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/sum.html)?**

[Mean() w/ missing values]{.underline}

```{r echo=TRUE}
mean(diamonds$price) #with missing values
mean(diamonds$price, na.rm = TRUE)  

```

[Sum() w/ Missing Values]{.underline}

```{r echo=TRUE}
sum(diamonds$price) #with mising values
sum(diamonds$price, na.rm = TRUE)  # Assuming the column is named 

```

[Analysis for mean() and sum()]{.underline}

In mean() and sum(), na.rm = TRUE removes any missing values present before performing the calculations. If there are missing values, mean() and sum() will return 'NA' otherwise.

**3.) Recreate the frequency plot of `scheduled_dep_time` colored by whether the flight was cancelled or not. Also facet by the `cancelled` variable. Experiment with different values of the `scales` variable in the faceting function to mitigate the effect of more non-cancelled flights than cancelled flights.**

[Download Flights Data and Prep:]{.underline}

```{r echo=TRUE}
# Load necessary libraries
# Load necessary libraries
install.packages("nycflights13")

library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

```

[Recreated Frequency Plot of scheduled_dep_time (colored by cancellation, faceted by cancelled variable, & scale variable set to minimize effect of relative quantities)]{.underline}

```{r echo=TRUE}
flights |> 
  mutate(
    cancelled = is.na(dep_time),  # Create a cancelled column (TRUE if dep_time is NA)
    sched_hour = sched_dep_time %/% 100,  # Extract hour from sched_dep_time
    sched_min = sched_dep_time %% 100,  # Extract minute from sched_dep_time
    sched_dep_time = sched_hour + (sched_min / 60)  # Convert to decimal time
  ) |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = sched_dep_time)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(aes(color = cancelled), binwidth = 1/4) +  # Plot frequency polygon
  facet_wrap(~cancelled, scales = "free") +  # Facet by cancelled variable
  ggtitle("Frequency of Scheduled Departure Time") +
  xlab("Scheduled Departure Time (hours)") +
  ylab("Frequency") +
  theme_minimal()
```

[Notes on experimenting with different scales:]{.underline}

In order to mitigate the effect of more non-cancelled flights than cancelled flights, the best scale variable values are "free" or "free_y", so that the cancelled flights scale is smaller and the charts are visually comparable.
